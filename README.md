# parti - Partition Information

## About

`parti` shows partition table information for

* mbr partition table
* gpt
* apple partition table
* el torito info

It shows the complete information but mostly in uninterpreted form (unlike
partitioning tools like `fdisk` or `parted`).

So it can be used to verify the data your favorite partitioning tool has
actually written.

## openSUSE Development

The package is automatically submitted from the `master` branch to
[home:snwint](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:snwint/parti)
OBS project. However, unlike other projects, is not submitted automatically to
openSUSE:Factory.

You can find more information about this workflow in the [linuxrc-devtools
documentation](https://github.com/openSUSE/linuxrc-devtools#opensuse-development).
